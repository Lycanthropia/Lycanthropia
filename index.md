## Game Concept
### Synopsis
The game takes place in a forest in the nighttime. In the forest lurks a werewolf who will immediately chase after you once it locks sight on you. You must avoid this werewolf at all cost, as you will die once it captures you. Your goal is to navigate around the forest, searching for useful items to lure the werewolf's attention away from you.
